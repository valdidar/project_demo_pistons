# Front-End Test Project

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end development task aimed at replicating a provided UI design using technologies such as Bootstrap and Vue.js. The design reference can be found in the provided Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Fc3fxJ7nmzfC0BPMoYmaeh/Font-End-Test-1?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design).

## Task Details

Your primary goal is to recreate the UI exactly as it appears in the Figma file. This includes replicating all animations, color codes, fonts, and other design elements. Make sure to pay close attention to details and strive for pixel-perfect accuracy.

### 2. GitHub Repository

Create a public GitHub repository to host your code. Ensure that your commits are clear, organized, and include meaningful messages. A well-structured repository will aid in the understanding and review of your work.

### 3. Deployment

Host your project on GitHub Pages or a similar platform to facilitate easy online review. This step is crucial for us to assess your implementation. Provide clear instructions in your README on how to access the deployed version.

## Technologies Used

You are encouraged to use the following technologies:

- **Bootstrap**: Utilize Bootstrap to streamline the development process and ensure responsiveness.
